Differential testing is the testing of two things to discover differences in their behavior.

The goal is to prove that the two things behave consistently, and that they do not diverge in behavior except for some expected differences. that should behave the same and broadly testing that all observable outcomes do not change, except for any expected changes.

This strategy is effective when building something new that should behave like something that already exists. That could be a new version of a contract that has unchanged behavior from it's previous version. Or it could be a refactor that expects no functional changes. Or it could be a reimplementation of the same interface.

This strategy can be used in the context of unit and integration tests, or in the context of fuzz tests as well.

:::tip

All contracts built with the Rust Soroban SDK have a form of differential testing built-in and enabled by default. See [Differential Testing with Test Snapshots].
