Differential testing is testing two things that should behave the same and broadly testing that all observable outcomes do not change, except for any expected changes.

This strategy is effective when building something now that should behave like something that already exists. That could be a new version of a contract that has unchanged behavior from it's previous version. Or it could be a refactor that expects no functional changes. Or it could be a rewrite.

This strategy can be used in the context of regular tests, like unit tests, or can be used in the context of fuzzing as well.

:::tip

All contracts built with the Rust Soroban SDK have a form of differential testing built-in and enabled by default. See [Differential Testing with Test Snapshots].
