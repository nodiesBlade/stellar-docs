Fuzzing is the process of providing random data to programs to identify unexpected behavior, such as crashes and panics.

Property tests are similar to fuzzing and also accept random input, just like fuzzing, but you write assertions for some property of the program. Property testing cares a lot about the intended behavior of the program.

Fuzzing as demonstrated here and elsewhere in these docs will use principles from property testing and fuzzing, but just use the term fuzzing to refer to both.

### How to Write Fuzz Tests

To experiment with writing a differential test, open a contract that you've deployed, or checkout an example from the [soroban-examples] repository and deploy it. To see a full example of a fuzz test see the [fuzzing example].

1. Install `cargo-fuzz`.

   ```console
   $ cargo install --locked cargo-fuzz
   ```

2. Initialize a fuzz project within your contract.

   ```console
   $ cargo fuzz init
   ```

3. Add the test to `fuzz/src/fuzz_target_1.rs`.



This test uses the same patterns used in [unit tests] and [integration tests]:
1. Create an environment, the `Env`.
3. Register the contract to be tested.
4. Invoke functions using a client.
5. Assert expectations.
